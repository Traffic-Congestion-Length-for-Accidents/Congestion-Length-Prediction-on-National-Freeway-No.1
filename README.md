# Congestion-Length-Prediction-on-National-Freeway-No.2


## Introduction


Me and my teammates participate in a competition launched by Taiwanese government and get merit award in the end. This study employs machine learning techniques to predict the congestion length after an accident, aiming to reduce prediction errors and the underestimation rate. 


## Data Source

This study utilizes weather factors from the Timeanddate website [https://tisvcloud.freeway.gov.tw/history-list.php], including temperature (°C), wind speed (km/h), humidity (%), and pressure (mbar). Additionally, it incorporates data from the Taiwan Freeway Bureau database[https://freeway2024.tw/links#links], including Etag static data (v2.0), M03A (vehicle traffic statistics), M06A (trip path data), roadwork sections (Jan–Oct 2023 & Jan–Feb 2024), National Freeway A1, A2, A3 accident records (Jan–Oct 2023 & Jan–Feb 2024), and traffic incident reports.
